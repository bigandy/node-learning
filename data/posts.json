After commuting back from work, then playing with Arthur in the evening, giving him his bath and putting him to bed. After this dinner, relax, bed. Where is there time for running?</p>\n<h3>Solution</h3>\n<p>There is a solution! Go running before Arthur wakes up, before work when it is quiet and the grass smells of dew. I&#8217;ve been doing this for the last two weeks. It is incredible! Once I get back I&#8217;ve already completed something challenging so that day is always going to be a successful one.</p>\n<h3>Outcome</h3>\n<p>I set up my running kit the night before, everything is ready so that I just have a glass of water and put my kit on and go. Anything that prevents you from running is a mental barrier so having organised the kit the decision has been made. Go running!</p>\n",
